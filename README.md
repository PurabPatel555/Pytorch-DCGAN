Pytorch-DCGAN
=======================

This is a simple DCGAN implementation in Pytorch modelled on the original paper "UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS" from ICLR 2016. This model uses Google Colab so that you can run it entirely on the cloud, on any machine! The dataset in the model can be changed for whatever you would like to try out: some interesting options are the Anime Faces Dataset from Kaggle (see Credits) and the MNIST numbers dataset. 

Usage
=====

This is a self contained Colab script-there are no requirements for your local environment 
If you are using a custom dataset, ensure that the files are found in the following folder structure on Google Drive:
